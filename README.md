## Description‚úåÔ∏è
Sorting visualizer is a frontend project with built with HTML, CSS and Javascript.
 I have tried to visualize all the basic sorting algorithm like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort.

## Tech 
HTMl, Css, javascript

## ‚ú® Requirements

* Any Browser (ie. Chrome, FireFox, Edge, Brave)
* A brain to think ü§ìü§ì

## Features

* Can Visualize 
  * Bubble Sort
  * Selection Sort
  * Insertion Sort
  * Quick Sort
  * Merge Sort
* Can change Speed
* Can change the size of bars
* Can take new bars (randomly changes the bars)

## ‚öô How it works ?!
-------------------
**_Here in our model, each element value is represented by ```THE SIZE OF THE BAR``` and the algorithms sort them by placing the smallest elements on the left and the biggest elements on the right**

**_The algorithms moves the items around by swapping elements, Without using any addational memory with creating another array.**
